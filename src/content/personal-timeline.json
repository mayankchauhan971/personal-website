    "description": "Built a personal styling platform to make fashion consultations accessible to everyone. Initially launched as a B2C solution where users could book sessions with professional stylists on an hourly basis. Later evolved into a B2B2C model, partnering with event planners, makeup artists and photographers to reach customers preparing for special events. \n \n On the tech side, we hired stylists to create thousands of data points on Indian body types â€” what works for different heights, weights, body structures and complexions. We fine-tuned a GPT model with this data and launched it as a Shopify app with brands for AI-powered styling recommendations. \n \n Eventually shut down because we were spread too thin across multiple approaches and ran out of resources.",
